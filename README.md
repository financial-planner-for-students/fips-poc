This proof of concept aims to uncover the following:
- RAG with Chatting via different mediums (Web-LLM, OpenAI, Ollama, Individual API keys)
- Financial Integration with different mediums
    - Plaid Integration
    - PDF/Image Integration
    - CSV Integration
- Frontend Plugins for custom graphs with D3.js

Prior to this POC, a brief development of another POC was done using [shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and their [recharts](https://ui.shadcn.com/charts) library integration. However, after careful investigation, recharts was deemed too abstract and did not have enough customization for the type of application we wanted to develop.

The current POC aims to further develop and refine the ideas that occurred from the prior POC and investigate the newer technologies aimed towards a more web approach instead of mobile.
